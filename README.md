# Alien-War-Game
Alien Game using HTML + JavaScript.

Left, Right, Top, Down and Space buttons are used to play this game. Space button is used to fire a bullet for removing ships from his way and four other buttons are used for controlling the Alien when ships are also attacking on the Alien through bullets. 

Each part of this game contains a piace of alien-game. There has added some addition code with old part to get next part of the code. There are comments in code and images (output of each html file) to understand code.
Video is also there for getting final result of the code.

Credits goes to Rishabh Jain from Coding Club India for this code.
